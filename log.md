### Organization of this repo for my challenge

1.    Check out the Official Site for the #100DaysOfCode movement. Connect with others on the platform of your choice from this list: www.100DaysOfCode.com/connect Also, here is a invite link to the 100DaysOfCode Slack channel - *Ok but I don't use Slack regulary.*
2.    Read Join the #100DaysOfCode - *Ok*
3.    Fork this repo and commit to the Log or to the Alternative, rapid R1 Log (R1 stands for Round 1) daily. (I choose r*n*-log.md standard)
4.    Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days. *Ok*
5.    Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward! *No, I already lost much time in social networks, I don't will do this*
6.    Change the date in Rules to the day you've started the challenge.  *Ok*
7.    Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.  *Ok*
8.    Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. *No, I already lost much time in social networks, I don't will do this*
9.    Follow Alex, creator of #100DaysOfCode & 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks @amanhimself for creating it! *No, I already lost much time in social networks, I don't will do this*
10.   Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away. *Ok*
11.   If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below) *No, I already lost much time in social networks, I don't will do this*
